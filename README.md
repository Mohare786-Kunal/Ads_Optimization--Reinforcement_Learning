# Ads CTR Optimization with Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains a robust implementation of ad click-through rate (CTR) optimization using advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. The project leverages **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)**, **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**, and **Thompson Sampling** to dynamically optimize ad placements for a synthetic dataset of 50,000 users. The goal is to maximize CTR by intelligently selecting ad positions (e.g., top_banner, sidebar, popup) based on user features and historical data.

The code is built with **Python**, **TensorFlow**, **Pandas**, and includes features like real-time adjustment, model checkpointing, and performance visualization. This project demonstrates expertise in RL, large-scale data analysis, and scalable system designâ€”key skills for tech internships at FAANG/MAANG companies.

## Features
- **Deep Q-Learning (DQN):** A neural network-based RL approach with experience replay and target networks for stable learning.
- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** A bandit-based algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation using confidence intervals.
- **Thompson Sampling:** A probabilistic approach using Beta distributions to model reward uncertainty.
- **Synthetic Dataset:** 50,000-user dataset with features like user_age, time_of_day, historical_ctr, and ad_position.
- **Real-Time Adjustment:** Dynamic CTR optimization with moving average tracking.
- **Visualization:** Plots training rewards to monitor performance.
- **Scalability:** Modular design with logging and checkpointing for production-ready applications.
